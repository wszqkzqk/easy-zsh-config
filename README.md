## Usage

### Apply to the Current User

- If you already have the file `~/.zshrc`, you may want to back it up:

```zsh
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak
```

- And run the following command to apply the configuration file to you home directory:

  - If you don't need to customize your `.zshrc` file and you want to keep your `.zshrc` file to the current one, run the following command:
  ```zsh
  ln -s /etc/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
  ```
  - If you want to customize your `.zshrc` file, run:
  ```zsh
  cp /etc/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
  ```

### Configure the Theme

- Edit line 2, ~/.zshrc, and replace default theme file path with your target theme file path.
